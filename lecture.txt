Authetication:-Identification
Authorization:-Providing access

Flow:-
    =>/register ==>so that we can post the user details into the database
    =>/login ==> so this was to send the email ans password to server so that it can be compared and user can login

    
    =>/moviedata (secured) for access we need permission(Authetication)
    =>/userdetails(secured) for access we need permission(Authetication)

    Ways to provide access:-
        i>send email and password whenever client is going to send the request at restricted routes (Not an optimised way)
        ii>Unique Identification ==>Token ==>Randam and Unique for all the client

        We will take help of JWT ==>Authetication ,Authorization and also for exchanging some information
        -Headers==>what type of token it is and encrption algorithm
        -Random Payload==>it contains some extra information about the token,which help in genrating the token
        -verifying signature==> it will as a secret key to decode the token and authenticate or authorize






        Hashing:-
                -used for storing the password
                -Not your plain text text password, it will to somethinga and then strore it in database
                -whey? =>so that no one can see the actual password
                -How?  =>
